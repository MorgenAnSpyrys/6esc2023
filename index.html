  <h2>What do you mean by "BWS"?</h2>
    <p>
        We are using a quasi Badge-Weighting-System(BWS). Please read the section below further describing the system:
    </p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h3>Quasi Badge-Weighting-System (BWS)</h3>
        <p>
            This Tournament uses a quasi Badge-Weighting-System (BWS). This is because tournaments at this rank range are not badged, but we want to exclude derankers who ruin the fun for everyone else.
            <br>We will be using Elitebotix to grab users' top 100 ranked tourney plays, and then run them through https://github.com/MorgenAnSpyrys/osu_true_rank
            <br>This will result in a new PP rating. If your new PP exceeds the amount provided by Bathbot's <rank 100000 at time of reg close, you will be screened out as out of range.
        </p>
    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
            The original quasi-bws functioned by relying on user self-reports, and we have since deprecated it in favour of the following system:
            <br>Players ranked between and including 100000 to 999999 Post-BWS at time of registration closing may be eligible to participate.
            <br>Ranking to 99999 (post-BWS) or higher within 90 days of regs closing will result in ineligibility. This is meant to discourage deranking.
            <br>We will be using BWS where recent tournament wins will be counted as "badges". This may affect your eligibility, so make sure to use the BWS calculator provided on this website.
