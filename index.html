  <h2>What do you mean by "BWS"?</h2>
    <p>
        We are using a quasi Badge-Weighting-System(BWS). Players will have to self-report recent tournament wins, and those will be treated like badges. If a player fails to correctly self-report, and this is brought to our attention by a third party after screening is complete, they will be disqualified. If screening is not yet complete or they self-reported and are still eligible rank-wise, they will be permitted to participate.
    </p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h3>Quasi Badge-Weighting-System (BWS)</h3>
        <p>
            This Tournament uses a quasi Badge-Weighting-System (BWS). This is because tournaments at this rank range are not badged, but we want to exclude derankers who ruin the fun for everyone else.
            <br>Players will have to self-report recent tournament wins (past 12 months), and those will be treated like badges.
            <br>If a player fails to correctly self-report, and this is brought to our attention by a third party after screening is complete, they will be disqualified. 
            <br>If screening is not yet complete or they self-reported and are still eligible rank-wise, they will be permitted to participate.
            <br>The BWS formula we use is Rank^(0.9915^(badges^2))
            <br> BWS Calculator: Rank-<input type="number" id="rank"> Wins-<input type="number" id="badges"> <input type="button" value="Calculate" onclick="BWS()"> Result-<input type="text" readonly="true" id="result">

    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
            Players ranked between and including 100000 to 999999 Post-BWS at time of registration closing may be eligible to participate.
            <br>Ranking to 99999 (post-BWS) or higher within 90 days of regs closing will result in ineligibility. This is meant to discourage deranking.
            <br>We will be using BWS where recent tournament wins will be counted as "badges". This may affect your eligibility, so make sure to use the BWS calculator provided on this website.
