  <h2>What do you mean by "BWS"?</h2>
  We are using a quasi Badge-Weighting-System(BWS). Players will have to self-report recent tournament wins, and those will be treated like badges. If a player fails to correctnly self-report, and this is brought to our attention by a third party after screening is complete, they will be disqualified. If screening is not yet complete or they self-reported and are still eligible rank-wise, they will be permitted to participate.
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <h3>Eligibility</h3>
  Ranking to 99999 (post-BWS) or higher within 90 days of regs closing will result in ineligibility. This is meant to discourage deranking. 
  We will be using BWS where recent tournament wins will be counted as "badges". This may affect your eligibility, so make sure to use the BWS calculator provided on this website.
