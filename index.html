  <h2>What is 6esc?</h2>
  6esc is a 6digit (100k+) 4v4ts8 Suiji national tournament limited to European countries.
  <h2>What is a Suiji tournament?</h2>
  Suiji format allows open, unlimited signups, but only the x highest rank players advance. For this tournament that means countries will not have tryouts, the players 8 ranked closest to 100k after "BWS" when regs close will represent their country.
  <h2>What do you mean by "BWS"?</h2>
  We are using a quasi Badge-Weighting-System(BWS). Players will have to self-report recent tournament victories, and those will be treated like badges. If a player fails to correctnly self-report, and this is brought to our attention by a third party after screening is complete, they will be disqualified. If screening is not yet complete or they self-reported and are still eligible rank-wise, they will be permitted to participate.
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <h3>Eligibility</h3>
  Ranking to 99999 or higher within 90 days of regs closing will result in ineligibility. This is meant to discourage deranking. 
  We will be using BWS where recent tournament wins will be counted as "badges". This may affect your eligibility, so make sure to use the BWS calculator provided on this website.
